FIX:
  Fix the padding on hex grid fills.

FEATURES:
  Full drawing control.
  
  Automatic design:
    (requires full drawing control)
    Automatically start (or restart) the pathfinder
    after the end of a draw (or delete). This makes
    additional controls unnecessary.

  Weighted graph:
    Like water and stuff.

  Configurable User Interface.

  Scrollable timeline.

  Hexagons Improvements:
    Choose between pointy-top and flat-top hexagons.
    Cube coordinate distances instead of euclidean.
